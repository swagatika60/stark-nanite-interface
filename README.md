## ⚡ Stark Lab Nanite Interface
**Prototype of Next-Gen Spatial Interaction**

This is a **full-stack creative engineering prototype** — where **GPU graphics**, **real-time gesture recognition**, and **mathematical motion**converge into a living holographic interface.

More than visuals: it’s an **interactive spatial** experience that responds to your movements like a futuristic lab assistant.

---

## 🌌 Project Overview 

This system merges multiple advanced technologies:

**-WebGL / Three.js** → GPU-powered 3D rendering

**-Custom GLSL shaders** → Nanite-style particle swarm

**-Mathematical physics** → Smooth, fluid particle motion

**-MediaPipe Hand Tracking** → Real-time gesture interface

**-Adaptive state machine** → Automatic or user-controlled modes

The end result is **an interface that feels alive**, responsive, and intelligent.

## ✋ Gesture Control

**-One Hand (Open):** Orbit the model by moving your hand.

**-Pinch (One Hand):** Pinch thumb + index → triggers **Next Phase** >> (Sphere → Grid → Rings).

**-Two Hands: Move hands closer** → Zoom In; spread → Zoom Out.

**-No Hands:** Activates **Auto-Pilot Mode** — the system evolves formations on its own.

**-Optional Future Gesture:** Wave to reset or trigger hidden effects.

💡 Gestures are fully math-driven, no buttons required.

## 1️⃣ Nanite Visual Engine

-Over **25,000** particles render in real-time without lag.

-Uses **shader-based computation** — avoids heavy meshes and textures.

-Glow and aura effects simulate **pure energy**, not just 3D points.

**Extra touch:** Particle intensity reacts subtly to movement speed, creating a living, breathing effect.

---

## 2️⃣ Fluid Particle Physics

-Smooth motion achieved via **LERP (Linear Interpolation)**.

-Particles **ease naturally** into new formations, no sudden jumps.

-Motion mimics **magnetic, fluid-like inertia**, giving each swarm a sense of life.

**Extra touch:** You can tweak “swarm elasticity” to create faster or slower morphing.

---

## 3️⃣ Algorithmic Geometry Engine

**-Sphere:** Spherical coordinates for perfect distribution

**-Grid / Lattice:** 3D structured arrangement

**-Vortex / Spiral:** Trigonometric + angular math creates dynamic spirals

**-Future shapes:** Potential for torus, Möbius strip, and organic formations

All **shapes generated mathematically**, allowing smooth transitions in real time.

---

## 4️⃣ Gesture Vision (Eyes of the System)

-Tracks **21 landmarks per hand**, fully in-browser

-Pinch, tilt, and hand position are **quantitative, not button-based**

-Hand data maps directly to **particle speed, rotation, and camera angles**

💡 Gesture recognition threshold is adaptive for different users.

---
## 5️⃣ 2D → 3D Mapping (The Bridge)

-Converts webcam 2D hand coordinates to 3D world motion

-Normalization, axis inversion, and rotation mapping ensure **natural response**

**-Hand movements influence:**

-Camera orbit

-Particle behavior intensity

-Morphing speed

**Extra touch:** Smooth damping avoids jitter and creates cinematic motion.

---
## 6️⃣ Adaptive State Machine Architecture

**Real-time loop (~60 FPS):**

**1.** Detect hand presence

**2.** If hands are present → **user-driven mode**

**3.** If no hands → **auto-pilot mode**

**4.** Smooth transitions between modes

**.** Never freezes, never waits — always **reactive and continuous.**

**.Potential future feature:** Multi-user recognition with separate control states.

---

## 🔬 Tech Stack

**.Rendering:** WebGL / Three.js

**.Shaders:** GLSL (vertex + fragment)

**.Math:** Linear algebra, LERP, vector transforms, spherical coordinates

**.Computer Vision:** MediaPipe Hand Landmarker

**.Engine:** State-machine-driven animation + gesture interaction

**Optional future add-ons:** Physics-based collisions, sound-reactive particles.
